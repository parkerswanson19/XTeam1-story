I am an empty node. For the past three months, I have been very lonely, waiting for someone to define me. I think that I want to be part of a linked list, a doubly-linked list that is. Or maybe I would like to be part of a binary tree, as all those nodes seem to share bonds on many different levels. Wherever I end up, I just want to belong and be happy.
It started to happen other nodes were being made. At first I thought to maybe we will be a linked list, but noticed that I was at the top of this list and the others were to the left and right of me. I wondered if this would be a normal binary tree or if it was going to be a balanced binary tree. Maybe a RBT or AVL tree. Lets wait and see.
