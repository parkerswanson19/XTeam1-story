I am an empty node. For the past three months, I have been very lonely, waiting for someone to define me. I think that I want to be part of a linked list, a doubly-linked list that is. Or maybe I would like to be part of a binary tree, as all those nodes seem to share bonds on many different levels. Wherever I end up, I just want to belong and be happy.
